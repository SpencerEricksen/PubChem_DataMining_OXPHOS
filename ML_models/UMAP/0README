# need to find optimal parameters for UMAP

# use the script plot_umap_all_v1.3.py to do a grid search of the 2 parameters:

- number_neighbors (nn)
- min_dist (md)


# after looking through these, I decided to use NN=50, md=0.250 as best setting
# to make this reproducible, I need to check random number seed

# to get UMAP coords for this setting, I ran "plot_umap_all_final_v1.4.py"
# which dumps pickle with UMAP coords for cpds for NN=50, and md=0.250


# I see that the umap transformer that I use to compute the chemical space map
# was not saved in the original code and must be re-computed if you want to 
# map new compounds in this original space.  Therefore, I added lines to save 
# the umap transformer as a pickle to use again later.
