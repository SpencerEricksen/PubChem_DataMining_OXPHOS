bitstring chemical fingerprints can be used for kernel

The Jaccard similarity is a proper symmetric distance function, positive-definite, and satisfies the triangle-inequality

Kernels are measures of similarity: s(a,b) > s(a,c) then objects a and b are more similar than a and c.

A distance metric can be converted to a similarity measure, such as a kernel.

For Jaccard similarity (Js), the Jaccard distance or Jd:

Jd = 1 - Js

For SVC, a kernel function can be provided:

# your kernel must take as arguments two matrices of shape (n_samples_1, n_features), (n_samples_2, n_features) and return a kernel matrix of shape (n_samples_1, n_samples_2).

def my_kernel(a,b):
    psim = jaccard_sim_matrix(a,b)       

clf = svm.SVC( kernel=my_kernel )
clf.fit(X,y)
